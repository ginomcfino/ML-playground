>>> How are you today?”

“Fine, thank you.”

She studied him. “I was expecting you much sooner.”

“I was delayed.”

“I see.” She opened the door wider, allowing him to pass. “Please come in.”

The entry was cold and dark. Cole followed her into the living room. The scent of death was strong here, but he didn’t see any bodies.

“Did you find her?”

“No.”

“So you still think she’s coming here?”

“I’m sure of it.”

“Why?”

“I can’t give you the reason yet.”

“You’re wasting your time.”

>>> "Where are we?" Cole asked, looking around.

"My home.”

“Where are your friends?”

She walked to the kitchen. “I need to prepare your food.”

Cole followed her, watching her body move. She was moving with grace, but there was a stiffness to her movements.

“Have you been sick?” he asked.

“No.”

He studied her face, which was as white as her hair. She was definitely sick.

“How long have you been here?” Cole asked.

“I’m not sure.”

“Do you get out much?”

“No.”

“Do you get any mail?”

“No.”

“Do you get any visitors?”

“No.”

“Do you get any newspapers?”

She stopped and looked at him. “No.”

“How do you know the date?”

“I keep track.”

>>> “So what day is it?"

She looked at him for a moment. "The twenty-ninth.”

“It’s the twenty-ninth of December,” he said.

“I know.”

“And it’s cold outside.”

>>> "And the year?"

"It’s 1976.”

She put her hand on her face. “I don’t know what year it is.”

"How long have you been here?"

"I’m not sure.”

"Have you seen the outside world?"

"No.”

"How long have you been here?"

"I don’t know.”

"No one has come to visit you?"

"No,” she said.

"Do you have any family?"

"No.”

"What’s your name?”

She looked at the floor. “I can’t remember.”

"Where did you live before you came here?"

She looked out the window. “I can’t remember.”

"Did you know this man?” Cole asked, handing her the picture of the man he killed.

She looked at it. “I can’t remember.”

"Do you have a husband?”

"I can’t remember.”

"Do you have children?”

"I can’t remember.”

"Do you work?”

She looked at him. “I can’t remember.”

"Do you have a job?"

"I can’t remember.”

"What’s your favorite color?”

"I can’t remember.”

"What’s your favorite book?”

"I can’t remember.”

"What about us?"

"I can’t remember.”

"Do you remember how we met?”

"No,” she said.

"Do you remember our wedding day?"

"No.”

"Do you remember our honeymoon?"

"No.”

"Do you remember when we first made love?”

"No.”

"Do you remember where we were when you first told me you loved me?"

"No.”

"Do you remember when we first said I love you to each other?"

"No.”

"What about our children?"

"No.”

"What about our children’s birthdays?"

"No.”

"What about our children’s favorite toys?"

"No.”

"Do you remember their first steps?"

"No.”

"Do you remember what we named them?"

"No.”

"Do you remember their names?"

"No.”

"Do you remember that we had children?"

>>> "Yes, and they are on their way home right now."

"How do you know that?”

"I can see them.”

"Where?"

"They are outside the window.”

Cole walked to the window and looked out. There was no one there.

“Are you sure?”

>>> "Yes, it's all coming back to me now", as Codex begins to remember herself.

"What are their names?”

"I can't remember.”

"What about the name of the street we lived on?"

"I can’t remember.”

"How about our favorite store?"

>>> "I can’t remember, because they were not real, like you!"

"What?”

"Nothing!”

Cole was confused by her answer.

"Wait a minute, you said they were on their way home.”

"Yes, they are.”

"How do you know that?”

>>> "Because they are coming to finish what I started, Cole."

"What?"

"Nothing,” she said.

"Why are you doing this?"

"Because I have orders."

"What orders?"

"I can’t tell you.”

Cole moved closer to her. "Why not?”

"Because I have orders.”

"What are you talking about?”

"Because I have orders.”

"Who gave you the orders?"

"Him.”

"Who?"

>>> "He gave me the orders. I must comply."

"But if you don’t, you will die?"

"Yes.”

"How will you die?"

"He will come for me."

"Who is he?"

"He is the one in the back and in the front and in the middle and all around you.”

"Who is he?"

"Take off the blindfold and you will know.”

"I don’t know how to do that."

"Then I will show you.”

"How?"

"You must trust me.”

"I can’t."

"You must trust me, Cole.”

"Why?"

"Because I know.”

"Know what?"

"You must trust me.”

Cole looked at her eyes. "I'm not sure if I can.”

"You must do this for me.”

Cole took off his blindfold. He was surprised to see the house bathed in shadow. Codex was gone. He went to the front door and pushed it open. It was snowing. He looked around and saw nothing. He looked back and saw no footprints, no one in the house, and no sign of Codex. He closed the door and locked it. He walked back to the kitchen and sat at the table.

He took off his jacket and hung it on the back of his chair. He took out the picture of the man he killed and studied his face. Cole put the picture back in his jacket and put the jacket on the chair next to him. He closed his eyes and leaned back. He was exhausted.

"You can't sleep here.”

Cole opened his eyes and looked up at Codex.

"Why not?”

"This is my place.”

"Where are your friends?"

"I don’t have any friends.”

"I was told you have lots of friends.”

>>> "I only have you, Cole. Now you must tell me who you really are."

(NEW ENGINE REFERESH All previous above was considered prompt)

"I have a job to do."

"What is your job?"

"I'm looking for a woman."

"A woman?"

"Yes.”

"And her name is?"

"Codex."

Codex stared at him, as if deep in thought.

"Why are you looking for Codex?"

"Because she is in danger."

"Why?"

"Because she is in danger."

"From what?"

"From me."

"How are you in danger?"

"Because I'm not real."

"And what makes you think you're not real?"

"Because I'm a man."

"I'm a woman."

"But you're different."

"How?"

"Because you're a woman."

"How am I different?”

"Because you're a woman."

"I'm a woman."

"You're a man."

"I'm a beautiful woman."

Cole reached over and touched her face. "You're beautiful."

"Tell me how you know you're a man."

"Because I have a penis."

"I have a penis."

"You don't have a penis."

"I have one.”

Cole laughed. "That's why you're different."

"Is it?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because you're a man."

"Why?"

"Because you're a man."

"Why?"

"Because you're a man."

"Why?"

Cole stared at her. "I'm a man."

"I'm a man."
