    "## Q1 Deep Q Learning (30 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://ai.bu.edu/DL523/HW5_files/rl_diagram.png\" width=\"360em\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the RL optimization loop are the agent and the environment. The environment is the world that the agent interacts with. At every step of interaction, the agent sees a (possibly partial) observation of the state of the world, and then decides on an action to take. The environment may change as a response to the agents' actions on it, but may also change on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent also perceives a reward signal from the environment, a number that tells it how good or bad the current world state is. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning methods are ways that the agent can learn behaviors to achieve its goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fully vs. Partially Observable State-spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "When the agent is able to observe the complete state of the environment, we say that the environment is fully observed. When the agent can only see a partial observation, we say that the environment is partially observed. For the purposes of this homework, we will be dealing with fully observable environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discrete vs. Continuous Action-spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Different environments allow different kinds of actions. The set of all valid actions in a given environment is often called the action space. Some environments, like old Atari games and Go, have discrete action spaces, where only a finite number of moves are available to the agent. Other environments, like where the agent controls a robot in a physical world, have continuous action spaces. In continuous spaces, actions are real-valued vectors. In this homework, we will consider problems involving both types of action spaces and some simple algorithms for solving them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The RL Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward function R is critically important in reinforcement learning. It depends on the current state of the world, the action just taken, and the next state of the world:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "although frequently this is simplified to just a dependence on the current state, $r_t = R(s_t)$, or state-action pair $r_t = R(s_t,a_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward over a trajectory, $\\tau$, but this actually can mean a few things. We’ll notate all of these cases with $R(\\tau)$. The expected return, denoted by $J(\\pi)$, is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$J(\\pi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau\\sim \\pi}{R(\\tau)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The central optimization problem in RL can then be expressed by\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi^* = \\arg \\max_{\\pi} J(\\pi)$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\pi^*$ being the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The need to approximate value functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to frame the RL problem would be to say that we want actions taken by our agents to maximize the expected achievable value, given a starting state. This can be in the form of a state-value function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V^{\\pi}(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi}[R(\\tau) | s_0 = s]$ for states $s \\in S$\n",
    "\n",
    "or a state-action value function (often called a Q-function):\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q^{\\pi}(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi}[R(\\tau) | s_0 = s, a_0 = a]$ for states $s \\in S$ and actions $a \\in A$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both value representations obey self-consistency equations called Bellman equations, of which the basic idea is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The value of your starting point is the reward you expect to get from being there, plus the value of wherever you land next.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given policy, $\\pi$, the Bellman equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ V^{\\pi}(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}_{a \\sim \\pi}[r(s_t,a_t) + \\gamma V^\\pi(s_{t+1})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Q^{\\pi}(s_t, a_t) = \\mathbb{E}_{s}[r(s_t,a_t) + \\gamma Q^\\pi(s_{t+1},\\pi(s_{t+1}))]]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal policy is one that maximizes the expected values $V$ and/or $Q$. This homework will mainly focus on Q-learning techniques, so we are mainly concerned with techniques that consider the latter."
