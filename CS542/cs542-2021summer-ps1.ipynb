However, people are not truly random and thus can be studied and analyzed. While this computer won’t win all rounds, over time it can exploit a person’s tendencies and patterns to gain an advantage over its opponent.\n","\n","Now play the game of the rock-paper-scissors against the computer at least 100 times while you record the outcome (your moves & the computer’s move) at each time into a text ﬁle. Record the score at the bottom of the ﬁle, i.e. your number of wins, losses and ties out of N tries (N ≥ 100). Now use this ﬁle to come up with some algorithm that takes as input the history to how the game has been played and estimate your best move for the next round. Put this algorithm into a simple program (use python 3.x) and play the computer again at least the same number of times you played before, but this time using your program. Record the score (hopefully there is an improvement in your score!!). Hint: the more you play the better you may be at guessing what the computer is up to. Also, note that we haven’t covered any ML techniques yet in the class yet, so this is just a warm up problem, so just do the best you can. You can also develop your playing system using data from one website and see if you can use it to improve your performance on the other website (transfer learning and generalization), though this is optional. \n","\n","After you implemented your algorithm and model, you may use it manually with the computer by type in the computer response at each round to your program, or you can write a script to interact with the webpage. But include at least two text files: history before using your algorithm, history after using your algorithm. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"S8rQSDc863tU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622863659586,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":286,"user":{"displayName":"Weiqi Ji","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiRc_lurXvTEHJP5V5WyLrpqT_gJ8NpF1QSAiNu=s64","userId":"04134633702671429219"}}},"source":["# Data extraction here: extract the data from the txt file to python input\n","# your input can be of any format, one suggestion is using integers 0,1,2 for rock paper scissor\n","\n","from google.colab import files\n","import random"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9F19p9g56wpU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622863659881,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Weiqi Ji","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiRc_lurXvTEHJP5V5WyLrpqT_gJ8NpF1QSAiNu=s64","userId":"04134633702671429219"}},"outputId":"5c498195-454c-4b6c-9a6b-0c9f96c0c51d"},"source":["#Define your algorithm here or define your own functions and procedure\n","# def rock_paper_scissor(history=None):\n","#     #
